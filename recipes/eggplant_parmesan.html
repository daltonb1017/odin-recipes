       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>This eggplant goes well with some steamed green beans and French or Italian bread. Although the recipe calls for seasoned bread crumbs, you can use regular bread crumbs if you wish. Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes according to your taste.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>1 egg</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
           <li>1 small eggplant, cut into 3/4 inch slices</li>
           <li>1 cup dried bread crumbs, seasoned</li>
           <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

           <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
